# BizBrain OS

> Three-zone context system — each zone loads the right amount of context for the task.

| Zone | Purpose | Open Claude Code Here For |
|------|---------|--------------------------|
| `launchpad/` | Start here (recommended) | Any session — code, business, planning, brainstorming |
| `brain/` | Full business intelligence | Deep brain operations, entity management, intake processing |
| `workspaces/` | Code projects (lean context) | Development work — fast, minimal overhead |

## Quick Commands (Available Everywhere)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/brain status` | Brain dashboard |
| `/todo` | View tasks |
| `/knowledge <topic>` | Load brain knowledge |

## Getting Started

1. **Start sessions in `launchpad/`** — optimized context with auto-capture
2. **Clone/create code repos in `workspaces/`** — lean context for fast dev work
3. **Use `brain/` for deep operations** — full context when you need everything

*Context is automatically optimized based on which zone you're in.*
